		<h2>A bit about me</h2>
		<p>
			Hi there.
			My name is Noam Lin and I've been developing software since I was 13 years old.
			I first started around 2003 using C++ and PHP.
			In my recent years I've been using JavaScript (NodeJS) working as a Full-Stack developer.
			On my website you'll find just few examples of my projects.
